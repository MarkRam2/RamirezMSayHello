Peer Review by; Pedro Castaneda - Your code is excellent. The only issue there was was that the sring 'name' was no declared globally so it cause some issues when you declared it in your while loop and then tried using 'name' later in your code (outside the while loop). You fixed the issue and now your code works without bugs! Great work. I liked the writing sytle you used.
